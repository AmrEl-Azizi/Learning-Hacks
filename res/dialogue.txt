M002-dia0-name-Mother:
M002-dia0-line-Come on honey, you have to head off to school.
M003-dia0-name-Mother:
M003-dia0-line-Hope you learned a lot in school today, Character.
T001-dia0-name-Teacher:
T001-dia0-line-Go to your desk so we can begin class.
T002-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
T002-dia0-line-I hope you enjoyed this class and learned something new today.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Hello kids, welcome to Intro to Java. I’m your teacher, Mr. Russman, and today I’m going to teach you basic variables.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-To start, their are two types of variables, primitives, like numbers, and Objects, like words.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Primitives are the most basic type, and they include all kinds of numbers from Integers to Decimals, as well as characters, which are letters and symbols.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Objects are more complicated, and they include words, which are called Strings.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Let’s try creating, or declaring, a variable. To do this for integers, you type “int testint;” Try this yourself.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Very good. As you can see, the first defined the type of variable. Let’s try to declare a character.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Amazing, you’re doing so well already.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-As of right now, your variables have no value. Let’s try to give them a value, by initializing it.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-To initialize a variable, you set it equal to an appropriate value. For example, for an Integer, you could make it the number 100.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Declare a variable that shows how old you are.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Very good. In case you didn’t notice, characters can only hold one character. If you want to make words, it’s time for us to learn about Strings.
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Strings are a little different than the primitive, but for now the only difference is that you use quotes to initialize it, “like this.”
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Why don’t you create a String that shows your name?
SC001-dia0-name-Bell:
SC001-dia0-line-*RING*
SC001-dia0-name-Mr. Russman:
SC001-dia0-line-Well class, that’s it for today, head on home. AND DON’T FORGET TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!
SC001-dia0-name-You:
SC001-dia0-line-I better do my chores. I have to go pick-up the groceries for my mom, check the mail, and get the trash.
C001-dia0-name-Leeman:
C001-dia0-line-Ah, Character, here to pickup your mother's groceries I assume.
C001-dia0-name-Leeman:
C001-dia0-line-1. Of course, thank you for saving them for us./n2. Yeah, yeah, just pass them to me.
C001-dia0-name-Leeman:
C001-dia0-line-You’re welcome.
C001-dia0-name-You:
C001-dia0-line-Where's the bag?
C001-dia0-name-Leeman:
C001-dia0-line-Try to be a little more grateful, your mom can’t get these herself you know.
C001-dia0-name-You:
C001-dia0-line-I'm sorry. So, where's the bag?
C001-dia0-name-Leeman:
C001-dia0-line-Here you go kid, try not to eat it all on the way home.

HW001-dia0-line-Printing things to the console is pretty simple.
HW001-dia0-name-Homework:
HW001-dia0-line-You just use the command, “System.out.println(String).” Try it yourself:
HW001-dia0-name-Mother:
HW001-dia0-line-It’s time to sleep son.
